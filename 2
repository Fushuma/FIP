# Fushuma Improvement Proposal #2 

### Initial Pre-Sale: Kickstarting Fushuma

Fushuma aims to be an investor-friendly blockchain platform ensuring transparency, decentralization, and rewards for FUMA token holders.

During the current phase, the founding team dedicated resources to lay the groundwork for Fushuma. This included writing the [**Blueprint**](https://fushuma.com/blueprint-for-decentralization/), articulating the vision behind Fushuma, designing the [**DAO mode**l](https://github.com/Fushuma/FIP/issues/2) to pursue total transparency and decentralization, developing the [**website**](https://github.com/Fushuma/Dev_grants/issues/11), and setting up a decentralized and transparent structure through [**a series of grants**](https://github.com/Fushuma/Dev_grants/issues) open to community members and developers. With the foundation firmly established, we are excited to move into the next phase with **Fushuma Improvement Proposal #2.**

Today, we are pleased to announce the beginning of the next phase with the Fushuma Improvement Proposal #2. **This proposal seeks to raise $75,000 by selling 75,000,000 FUMA tokens at the price of $0.001 per token.**

## Why This Round?

Funding the treasury with an initial amount is essential to kickstart several initiatives. These initiatives are designed to validate and establish the processes Fushuma has put in place. Success for these initiatives will be measured by increased community engagement, the successful deployment of the DeFi platform, and heightened awareness of Fushuma.

**This funding opportunity is explicitly dedicated to initial investors who want to support and validate Fushuma's model.** Investors will receive FUMA tokens at a discounted price compared to future rounds. These early investors will have the opportunity to participate in the decision-making process and track how their investment is utilized. Initially, they can submit and comment on proposals on GitHub. Once the DAO is launched, they can vote using their FUMA tokens.

## What Is The Plan?

We plan to allocate the money raised as follow:

- **DeFi Platform Creation:** 25%.
- **Marketing:** 40%.
- **Infrastructure:** 15%. 
- **Community Initiatives:** 10%.
- **Reserve:** 10%.
- **Total:** 100%

## I. Creating and Launching a DeFi Platform Based on PancakeSwap (25%)

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has steadily gained traction and recently [**surpassed centralized exchanges**](https://www.theblock.co/post/308132/dex-market-share-surges-to-record-high-outpacing-centralized-exchanges?utm_source=telegram1&utm_medium=social) due to its inherent transparency and user control. Establishing a decentralized platform where users can trade FUMA and various tokens aligns with these trends. At this stage of the project, we prioritize a decentralized approach over centralized exchanges.

To achieve this, we are considering two potential paths:

**1. Relaunch SLOFI:** [**Sloth Finance**](https://sloth.finance/), an existing project on Callisto Network with a known community and user base, can be relaunched on Fushuma.

**2. Create a New Project:** Develop a new project from scratch. The new token's total supply should match SLOFI's total supply, with a 1:1 allocation to SLOFI holders. More details about SLOFI tokenomics can be found [**here**](https://soy-finance.medium.com/slofi-tokenomics-d0866f7c3cd6).

Fushuma will allocate initial liquidity in FUMA tokens to support this initiative. Specific details will be discussed on a case-by-case basis.

## II. Marketing Activities: Banner Campaign, YouTube Videos, CoinTelegraph Article (40%)

Raising awareness about Fushuma is crucial. A significant portion of the budget raised will be allocated to marketing, divided into three key areas:

- **Banner Campaign On Top Crypto Websites**

Leverage the existing traffic of popular crypto websites to capture a percentage for Fushuma, driving awareness effectively through the impressions generated.

- **YouTube Videos**

YouTube is a powerful tool for building awareness over time, as viewers tend to relate to the speaker in the video. We plan to release one video per week for 3 months to engage, inform and expand the community.

- **CoinTelegraph Article**

Publishing on CoinTelegraph, a leading platform for crypto news, will effectively reach the crypto community and build strong SEO for Fushuma through valuable backlinks. We plan to release sponsored articles written by CoinTelegraph authors, including a Related News Widget and 24-hour Homepage pin promotions.

## III .Community Initiatives (10%)

This allocation will be dedicated to funding activities proposed by the community through our grants program. By supporting innovative projects and ideas from community members, we aim to foster active engagement and ensure that the development of the Fushuma ecosystem is truly community-driven. This will include but is not limited to development grants, community events, educational initiatives, and other projects that align with Fushuma’s goals.

## IV. Infrastructure (15%)

Fushuma will requires high-end hardware and robust infrastructure to ensure seamless operation and security. This allocation will be used to invest in the necessary hardware to support the Fushuma blockchain. This ensures that the network remains efficient, secure, and capable of handling increased usage as the community grows.

## V. Reserve (10%)

The reserve will act as a contingency fund to address unexpected expenses or opportunities that align with Fushuma’s long-term vision. This could include, but is not limited to, acquiring key partnerships or funding projects that require additional resources beyond the planned budget.
