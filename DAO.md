## Summary

A decentralized and transparent on-chain management model for the Fushuma Treasury. 

## Abstract

The proposed mechanism aims to establish a self-funded and self-sustained ecosystem, maximizing decentralization and transparency within the Fushuma Network. It leverages Augmented Bonding Curves (ABC) and decentralized governance through Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) to manage allocated treasury funds, increase liquidity, and support continuous project funding. 


## Motivation

The aim of the Treasury DAO is to support the expansion of the Fushuma ecosystem by leveraging treasury coins for project funding with minimal impact on inflation with respect to the coins in circulation. This proposal addresses key challenges such as market volatility, liquidity limitations, and project valuation accuracy, fostering a self sustained and self funded ecosystem.

## Specification

The Treasury DAO consists of two primary pools: the Development Pool and the Liquidity Reserve Pool. The Development Pool funds projects to accelerate the Fushuma ecosystem's expansion through grants controlled by a democratic DAO. The Liquidity Reserve Pool provides liquidity to investors, ensuring continuous liquidity and fair valuation through the ABC mechanism.


### Treasury DAO Components

1. **Development Pool:**
   - Used to fund projects to accelerate the Fushuma ecosystem's expansion.
   - Grants are controlled by a respective DAO, with decisions made through democratic voting.
   - Funded projects reward investors with tokens, similar to staking rewards.

2. **Liquidity Reserve Pool:**
   - Serves as a reserve to provide liquidity to those who have funded the ecosystem.
   - Operates based on the Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC), an automated market maker (AMM).
   - Ensures continuous liquidity and fair valuation by adjusting token prices dynamically according to supply and demand.

### Mechanism Operation

1. **Token and Fund Allocation:**
   - Individuals deposit funds into the DAO and receive Fushuma tokens in return.
   - Deposited funds are split into the Reserve Fund and the Development Fund.

2. **Preventing Market Dumping:**
   - Vesting and lock-up mechanisms prevent large-scale market dumping along with burning mechanism for withdrawals.

3. **Governance:**
   - Performed through a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).
   - The DAO oversees fund allocation and project approvals, ensuring community participation and decentralized control.

### Augmented Bonding Curve (ABC) Details

- The Reserve Fund operates based on an ABC mechanism, providing price discovery and liquidity management.
- **Buying Tokens:** As more tokens are bought, the price increases due to higher demand.
- **Selling Tokens:** As tokens are sold, the price decreases, maintaining balance in the system.

## Rationale

The Treasury DAO mechanism provides a sustainable and transparent funding model, addressing the critical issues of market volatility, liquidity, and project valuation. By leveraging ABCs and decentralized governance, the system ensures continuous funding, fair ecosystem valuation, and active community engagement.

## Backwards Compatibility

This propprojectsosal does not affect any existing standards and is fully compatible with existing Ethereum-based protocols and smart contracts.

## Exact mathematical model, Parameter selection and Implementation

To be defined in subsequent FIPs and technical specifications.


## Conclusion

The proposed Treasury DAO mechanism represents a significant advancement in blockchain project funding. By integrating augmented bonding curves with decentralized governance, it provides a sustainable and transparent funding model that aligns the interests of all stakeholders, towards enhancing the long-term growth and success of the Fushuma Network.
